# Member access: "." and "->" operators (or dot and arrow operators)

To access a member from a pointer to an object use "->"  
To access a member from an object use "."


__Kodexempel A__

{% highlight c++ linenos %}
class Car{
public:
    Car() : model_number(0) {}
    int model_number;
};
 
int main(){
    Car* ptrToCar = new Car();
    // use -> (arrow-operator) to access the members of the object when accessing through a pointer
    ptrToCar->model_number = 15;
     
    // ptrToCar->model_number is the same as writing "(*ptrToCar).model_number" (in most cases)
    (*ptrToCar).model_number = 15;
}
{% endhighlight %}

You need a pointer to use the "arrow-operator"



__Kodexempel B__

{% highlight c++ linenos %}
class Car{
public:
    Car() : model_number(0) {}
    int model_number;
};
 
int main(){
    Car myCar;
    // use . (dot-operator) to access the members of the object directly
    myCar.model_number = 15;
     
}
{% endhighlight %}
